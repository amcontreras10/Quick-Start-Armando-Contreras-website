5. Usage 
This project is meant to be a template for websites for Opera Singers. The basic structure of Home Page with Media Files, Biography Page, Media Page for audition videos, Roles Performed Page, Upcoming Performances Page and Studio Page for teaching have been developed here. 
This website template will help the opera singer have competitive, easy and accessible content for future employers and prospective voice students. 

6. Roadmap 
a. All Pages - Built with Bootstrap Nav Bar for Header and Footer 
               Font of DM Sans from GoogleFonts
               All texts and photos styled to be in the center of the page 
               Background color Bootstrap blue 

b. index.html- Built with Bootstrap Carousel to present photos of opera singers 

c. aboutme.html- can insert any bio in between the <p></p>

d. schedule.html- all photos set to height and width of 400. Can insert logos from opera companies website and insert details of upcoming performances. 

e. media.html- template to insert any video for upload. Used y2mate.com to convert youtube videos into presentable videos into code. Have control poster on each video so you can insert any photo while videos load. 

f. roles.html- Built with Bootstrap table and Bootstrap table-hover. Easy to switch out content for your own. 

g. studio.html- Built with Bootstrap forms and used formspree.io for information to process. This page is meant for students to study with the opera singer. It can be an extra source of income for the opera singer to be a teacher. This page will be used for inquiries.

8. Ideas for future improvement 
a. You can add an extra media page with a gallery for pictures. Employers love to see as much media content as they can in a website. Adding a media page dedicated to pictures and using Bootstrap to develop a photo gallery would be ideal. 

b. Cleaning up files using .gitignore earlier in the process. I used .gitignore late in the process and in doing so there are a lot of unnecessary files on GitHub globally. 

c. Different fonts and backgrounds. For uniformity, I used one central font and one central background. In the future for nuance, you can impletement separate styles for separate pages. A lot of my styles.css folder was used as a uniform stylesheet for all pages on the website.
